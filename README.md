# AES-128-key-schedule

Run main.c to obtain a 32-bit element input array, namely, "words". 

The aforementioned array will contain 44 elements with each element being 32-bit, i.e., array memory in total is 176 bytes.

That array can be used for encrytion and decryption protocols in "AES-128-enc-dec" repository.
